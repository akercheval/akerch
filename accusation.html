      <h4>A sample email for blast accusations to cyber criminal suspects</h4>

        Hello [name of recipient],<br><br>
I’m going to cut to the chase. I know you [are a phisher/involved in ransomware/malware, etc.]. More importantly, I worked on the case investigating you and people like you, trying to bring you to jail. You don’t know me personally, and I didn’t go out looking to burn you. It’s just bad luck that one of our researchers found your activity while scouring the web and I was assigned to your case. It’s good luck, though, that I’m about to leave my company and am incredibly pissed off at my boss. It’s even better luck that I’m the owner of the master copy of your entire file on our system, and since I’m interested in anything that will make my boss’s life more difficult, I’m going to offer to delete all the information we have about you today.<br><br>

I don’t want your money or your admiration or anything, I’m just offering to delete your shit because I don't think you're <em>that</em> bad of a guy and because my boss is such an idiot he won’t even know it was me who did it. Just say the word and it’s done.<br><br>

Of course, I get it, you’re probably thinking “why would I email a cybersecurity investigator at all, even if he is trying to help me out?” To which I say fine, whatever, but do know that we’re very close to getting a warrant to investigate even further into your case, like 2 weeks, tops. We’ve already got a backdoor into your system and are just waiting for the warrant to use it and go through all your stuff. So I’d do some cleanup if you choose to ignore me.<br><br>

Either way, let me know what you want to do. I leave the office forever tomorrow, so act quickly.
